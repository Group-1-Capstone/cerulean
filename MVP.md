## MVP : Cerulean

- A Mental Wellness App that starts out using a form that prompts a user to select how they're feeling from a set of options and places them in a room. Our goal is to have a minimum of 2 designs for rooms where users can chat with other users through their avatars and another room with a single-player game. We'll be using Socket.io, Phaser and our stack.

## Technical Challenges:

- At least 2 users subscribed to same socket.
- implementing the chat room feature.

## POC:

- 1 multiplayer room and 1 single player room (single player room could be room with journal)
- A working Phaser game
- responding to sockets.
